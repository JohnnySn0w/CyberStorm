This repo currently contains a few things, hopefully it'll be quite full by the time cyberstorm comes around.

The idea for the repo is that we have a centralized and group audited set of tools to use during the course of 442.

This is where group projects and useful bits of hacking code and scripts are to be deposited.

Some general things to know:
-you cannot review your own pull requests, that must be done and the PR confirmed OK by 2 group members that are not you. This 	is to ensure integrity of the system.
-Please properly label things, and use the project tab to communicate with the team what pieces you're working on and your
 progress on those.
